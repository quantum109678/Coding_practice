    Create a list,seqList , of N empty sequences, where each sequence is indexed 0 from to N-1. The elements within each of the sequences also use 0-indexing.
    Create an integer,lastAnswer, and initialize it to 0.
    The types of queries that can be performed on your list of sequences (seqList) are described below:
        Query: 1 x y
            Find the sequence,seq, at index((x^lastAnswer)%N) in seqList .
            Append integer y to sequence seq.
        Query: 2 x y
            Find the sequence,seq, at index((x^lastAnswer)%N) in seqList.
            Find the value of element y%size in seq(where size is the size of seq) and assign it to lastAnswer.
            Print the new value of lastAnswer on a new line.
